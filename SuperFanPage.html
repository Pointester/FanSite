<h1>Kanye Omari West</h1>
<p><img src="kanye.jpeg" width="300" height="293" alt=""/></p>
<p>Ye formerly known as Kanye West was born in atlanta georgia on June 8, 1977 and raised by his parents until their divorce in 1980, after this Kanye was raised by his mother in south chicago where he would foster a love for music. Kanye spent a year in china with his mom. After returning he found a passion for, hip-hop this increased when he met a local dj/producer named No ID. Ye was really interested in producing music which lead to him getting side gigs with smaller rappers, he would eventually get his big break after moving to Neewark New Jersey when he produced "This can't be life" and  &quot;The Takeover&quot;for Jay-z . This success lead to other artist wanting him to produce for him, he soon would make songs for stars like Common, Beyonce, Alisha Keys, Beanie sigel, and even Janet Jackson. Ye wasn't content with this success because he wanted to become a musician in his own right, so he signed with Roc-A-Feller as a rapper (he was initially signed as a producer). There were initially a lot of doubters who didn't believe in his abilities as a rapper, the main famous one being Jay-Z. Everything would change when Ye got into a nearly fatal car crash in 2002, he channeled all the pain he was experienced and put it in the song through the wire. It was a smash hit and later lead to the release of his debut album, "The college dropout". This sparked his career and made his next releases heavily anticipated. A year later he would release his next album, "late registration" which made him a superstar and made him as popular as possible for a new artist in 2005. He continued growing to the point were he is today after many controversies over the years.</p>
